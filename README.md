### My published shaders

I don't publish all my creations and experiments, I only set a shader public when I think it's presentable and can be inspiring, I think this is what everyone is doing, this avoids to have too much public shaders to browse on Shadertoy. 

In general, I also try to gives instructions to have different fun results by a simple modification of a line of code. **This is a toy** ! 

Many times, friends ask me **how many time** it took to me to make these shaders.
I can tell between 10 to 20 hours of cumulated work in general to get a presentable result for the community and publish it. 
First have the idea and want to share it, work on the message associated to your creation, and good animation, limited artifacts, colors etc. 
As IQ repeat in these videos, **you just need to fix ugly things**, and this needs a lot of time for a newbie, but it's realy pleasant. And the more you learn, the more you are able to see ugly things to fix.

By inverse order of creation time.

| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| [Bee Waggle Dance](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ssX3W2) | I started by trying to replicate the map of my dinner room that has some bee pattern on it, and this ended with this. | ![No Preview](https://www.shadertoy.com/media/shaders/ssX3W2.jpg) |
| [Egg Hunt](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ttyfDV) | Very quickly done with the new template of BigWings plus domain repetition and fun result ! I think the humain brain is wired to catch Eggs. | ![No Preview](https://www.shadertoy.com/media/shaders/ttyfDV.jpg) |
| [Heart Ribbon](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wtdBzl) | The Helicoid shape is far more complicated than I expected, obviously because with the difference of the Archimedian spiral, it's a 3D space figure. | ![No Preview](https://www.shadertoy.com/media/shaders/wtdBzl.jpg) |
| [Waiting for two injections](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3tGcDR) | On this one I played with the 3D fonts and the transparent effect. There is also a more serious message, of hope for 2021. But I'am not here to propagate any political message. | ![No Preview](https://www.shadertoy.com/media/shaders/3tGcDR.jpg) |
|[Happy New Year using a Scytale !](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3tdczX)| My creation after searching for HELIX functions. | ![No Preview](https://www.shadertoy.com/media/shaders/3tdczX.jpg) |
|[Decorated Christmas Spiral](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3dVfDc)| After searching for archimedian spiral functions. Fun to see that many comments were about the twisted cylinders wrapped around the spiral, much simplier to get. | ![No Preview](https://www.shadertoy.com/media/shaders/3dVfDc.jpg) |
|[Kawaii Looper Caterpillar](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WdcfDs)| After studying IQ's joint functions based on a set of capped torus, and BigWings 2D shaders technics (smiley face youtube tutorials). I had fun testing the results of diffrents procedural patterns from Shane, I spent also many time to work on the amination. ** * |![No Preview](https://www.shadertoy.com/media/shaders/WdcfDs.jpg)|
|[Rocket planet](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wdVyDR) | After searching for some polyhedron functions in order to compute only 1 rocket. |![No Preview](https://www.shadertoy.com/media/shaders/wdVyDR.jpg)|
|[Walking donuts](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tscfzs)  | After working on polar repetition. **tuto**|![No Preview](https://www.shadertoy.com/media/shaders/tscfzs.jpg)|
|[Roundabout symetry](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ts3yzB)  |**tuto** polar repetition, I think this transformation is missing the the IQ page about distance functions. But this is mentioned in one of his video tutorial. |![No Preview](https://www.shadertoy.com/media/shaders/ts3yzB.jpg)|
|[Rocket Toy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3dSBRG)|***Was very happy with this one***. I modelled the rocket for the first time with IQ's SDFs, without even understanding how the ligthing is working. Added a BigWings tutorial starfield background. Tried also a glow effect. Newbies can dare all. |![No Preview](https://www.shadertoy.com/media/shaders/3dSBRG.jpg)|
|[SDF for Moss's Egg - for comment](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wsBBR3) |I'am so proud, this stupid function of mine (total newbie) is mentioned on the IQ page about 2D distance functions ! How this can be possible ? This pushed me to find more distance functions, on spirals, helix ... but have the chance to find something really new is an illusion for a a beginner, I have to learn first ! |![No Preview](https://www.shadertoy.com/media/shaders/wsBBR3.jpg)|
